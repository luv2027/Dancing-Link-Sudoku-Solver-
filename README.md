# DLX Sudoku Solver

This project provides an implementation of Donald Knuth's Algorithm DLX (Dancing Links) for solving Sudoku puzzles. The solution is provided in both C++ and JavaScript, allowing you to solve Sudoku puzzles through a simple web interface.

## Overview

Algorithm DLX is an efficient algorithm for solving exact cover problems. Sudoku can be formulated as an exact cover problem, making Algorithm DLX suitable for solving it. This project includes:

- A C++ implementation of Algorithm DLX to solve Sudoku puzzles.
- A JavaScript implementation of the same algorithm to create a web-based Sudoku Solver.

## C++ Implementation

The C++ implementation of Algorithm DLX enumerates all solutions to an exact cover problem. The program takes a partially filled Sudoku grid as input and outputs the solved grid.
